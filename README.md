# Tibia-preop-planning-Blender-addon
Pre-operative planning, as name suggests, involves measuring a few lengths and angles in human bone under study and values compared with standard range to identify corrective action. This process starts with identifying a few landmarks by the design engineer, creating axes and planes using them. Further before taking measurements, the points must be projected onto a particular plane.  This addon has 4 parts namely, “Landmarks & Axes”, “Projections”, “Angles” & “MeasureIt”.

Landmark selection involves total 15 landmarks to get all the measurements. Skipping any of the landmarks will not cause any problem while using the add-on but will show an error message when that measurement needs the landmark. User has to identify the landmarks, keep the 3D cursor at that location before clicking on the button in UI panel of add-on. 

As we create landmarks, angles, axes etc, the respective object will be saved under particular collection name as shown in below picture. This helps user in easy identification of similar group of items.

Next part of add-on is projections. For landmarks assiged in previous step need to be projected at a particular planes. The script will take care of creating these projections in a single click reducing the burden on user. These projections will also be saved under different collection named “projections” in collection. 

Angles part has few angles button which user can click and use measureit buttons to measure the distances and angles.
